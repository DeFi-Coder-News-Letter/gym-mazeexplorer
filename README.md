# gym-mazeexplorer

A maze exploration environment for openai/gym.

## Game modes

### `MazeExplorer-v0`

* `-10` and terminal state on wall collision

#### When battery above 50%

* `1` exploration reward on first visit to tiles

This could be considered "cheating" as `visited` state is not observable in environment and reward is generated by ground-truth.

#### When battery below 50%

* `100` reward goal state on reaching spawn tile
* No futher exploration rewards

Spawn tile is no different to any other from agents perspective, must remember how to return to it.

## Installation

```bash
pip install gym-mazeexplorer
```

## Quick example

```python

  import gym
  import gym_mazeexplorer

  env = gym.make('MazeExplorer-v0')
  env.reset()

  for _ in range(50):
    env.render()
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
```
